    <h3> Research </h3>
    <p> I do not yet have a well-defined field of research; in the past, I have worked with optimal transport, autoencoders of various flavours, multi-modal large language models. I am also interested in geometric flows, stochastic processes, and graph theory. </p>
    
    <h3> Writing </h3>
    <p> On occasion, I write on things ancient and abstract. Particular interests are Thucydides, Plato, Heraclitus, Pindar, and Herodotus. </p>
